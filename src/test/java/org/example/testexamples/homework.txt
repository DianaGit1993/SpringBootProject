Exercise 4: Testing Collaborative Objects
 1. Create a class that collaborates (uses other dependencies) with one or more other objects through method calls.
 2. Use Mockito to mock the collaborator objects and simulate their behavior.
 3. Write test cases using JUnit to verify that the class under test interacts correctly with its collaborators
 (the other dependencies called in the class under test).
 4. Verify that the expected methods are called with the correct arguments on the mocked objects.
